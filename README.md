My app is called Reci-me, a personal digital recipe book designed to keep all beloved recipes.
here are a few screenshots:

basically how it works is you have to input all the necessary info where it's needed; the name, ingredients, category of the food and its ratingg. Once done, save it by pressing the "add" button, and to view it, press the "view" button. Pressing exit will close the app completely.
How I handled errors is that if the spaces are blank, the app will not move to the next step unless you input values in all of the respective spaces.
the app is supposed to ensure that all recipe information is shown on the second activity
